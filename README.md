## Suggested Study Habits

My number 1 tip is to not try to cram everything in at once. The brain needs time to digest. Spread out your study in bite-sized chunks throughout the week. I suggest the following schedule:

- Wednesday, before lecture (30 minutes to 1 hour)

  - Skim the chapter and try the end-of-chapter quiz once, quickly. Don't worry about getting everything right or about fixing the problems you got wrong. Write down some questions you had about the chapter and about the problems.

- Thursday, after lecture (30 minute to 1 hour)

  - Try the quiz again. Focus on understanding the problems. If you get 100% and feel confident in your understanding, you're done. If you still struggle after a while, write down your problem areas and come back later.

- Weekend, before Monday (as needed)

  - Review the chapter as needed. Try finishing the quiz and getting 100%. If you are still struggling after two hours, write down your problem areas and come to office hours on Monday.

- Monday (as needed)

  - Come to office hours if needed. The chapter quiz is due at the end of the day so focus on developing the understanding necessary to score 100% on it.

## Course Description

### Prerequisites

Qualifying scores on ELM and EPT, or exemption, or satisfactory completion of appropriate developmental courses.

### Course Overview

Alfred Marshall once described economics as the "study of manking in the ordinary business of life." I can't think of a better description. Economics helps us understand everything from business and politics to marriage and dating. It is not just a field of study. It is a way of thinking that helps us understand the world and the people around us. I can't think of a better subject for future CEOs, politicians, and leaders. I can't think of a better subject for becoming a more informed citizen.

In this class, you will begin your journey to **thinking like an economist**. Primarily, this means being able to see how private incentives and market forces shape the way people behave and how societies are organized. The starting point will be supply and demand in competitive markets and its applications. We will then turn to more advanced topics, like public goods, externalities, and more complex market structures.

### Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- **Explain** what the study of economics is and **discuss** the role of economic theory in shaping different views of markets and public policy.

- **Explain** the principle of supply and demand and explain why economists generally believe that free markets are an efficient way to allocate resources.

- **Explain** the circumstances under which free markets fail to allocate resources efficiently and **discuss** the role of government under these circumstances.

- **Analyze** the economic principles and forces that shape a variety of real-world scenarios and market structures.

- **Predict** and **calculate** equilibrium outcomes in a variety of real-world scenarios and market structures using the appropriate economic concepts and models.

## Course Materials

### Required Textbook

The required textbook is *Principles of Microeconomics* by Edward Kung (ISBN: 9781644967027). It is a digital textbook that can be purchased from www.grlcontent.com. Click on "purchase" and enter your institution (California State University, Northridge) and select "Principles of Microeconomics". Make sure you select the correct section! You should be enrolled in one of the two following sections:

- Fall 2023: Kung: Econ 160-02
- Fall 2023: Kung: Econ 160-03

You can also purchase access cards from the CSUN Bookstore.

### Calculator

A handheld calculator will be required for exams and some quizzes. Calculators with programming capabilities are not allowed.

### Video Lecture Series

A series of video lectuers I recorded during COVID is available free of charge. These are optional but may be a helpful supplement to the textbook chapters. They cover the same material as the textbook.

## Suggested Study Habits

My number 1 tip is to not try to cram everything in at once. The brain needs time to digest. Spread out your study in bite-sized chunks throughout the week. I suggest the following schedule:

- Wednesday, before lecture (30 minutes to 1 hour)

  - Skim the chapter and try the end-of-chapter quiz once, quickly. Don't worry about getting everything right or about fixing the problems you got wrong. Write down some questions you had about the chapter and about the problems.

- Thursday, after lecture (30 minute to 1 hour)

  - Try the quiz again. Focus on understanding the problems. If you get 100% and feel confident in your understanding, you're done. If you still struggle after a while, write down your problem areas and come back later.

- Weekend, before Monday (as needed)

  - Review the chapter as needed. Try finishing the quiz and getting 100%. If you are still struggling after two hours, write down your problem areas and come to office hours on Monday.

- Monday (as needed)

  - Come to office hours if needed. The chapter quiz is due at the end of the day so focus on developing the understanding necessary to score 100% on it.
